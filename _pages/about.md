My name is Chengjhih Shih. I'm a first-year PhD student at Georgia Tech's EIC Lab, supervised by Prof. Yingyan (Celine) Lin. My research interests include computer architecture and high-performance computing, with a focus on 3D neural rendering acceleration and chiplet accelerators.

**Will be more descriptions about my PhD journey in the future**

Before coming to Georgia Tech, I received my BS and MS from the Department of Computer Science at National Taiwan University (NTU), where I worked on a variety of research projects:

### Accelerating Quantum Simulations
I worked with **Prof. Shih-Hao Hung** at NTU on quantum annealing acceleration, restructuring simulated quantum annealing (SQA) using CUDA and Tensor Cores, achieving an 86X speedup. This was presented at **ISC High Performance 2022**. I also contributed to large-scale circuit-based quantum simulations on NVMe disks, showcased at **Future Tech** in Taiwan.

### Software Optimization and Hardware Design for Cryptosystems
In collaboration with **Prof. Bo-Yin Yang** at Academia Sinica, I accelerated polynomial multiplication in lattice-based cryptosystems using the NTT, with ARM assembly optimizations for Saber and NTRU, accepted at **Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems (CHES)**. I also designed an FPGA for the multivariate cryptosystem "oil and vinegar," submitted to **NIST PQC Digital Signature Schemes**.

### Specialization and Co-Design for Homomorphic Encryption (HE)
Since 2022, Iâ€™ve worked with **Wistron** on HE hardware acceleration. My focus included FPGA synthesis and multi-FPGA prototypes, with work showcased at **Mobile Internet Security 2023**, forming the basis of my master's thesis.
